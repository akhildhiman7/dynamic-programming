# Dynamic Programming Solutions

Welcome to the **Dynamic Programming Solutions** repository! This repository is dedicated to storing and organizing solutions to various dynamic programming problems. Each solution is implemented in C++ and is accompanied by comprehensive documentation to help you understand the underlying algorithm and approach.

## Repository Highlights

- **Structured Solutions:** Each problem's solution is stored in a separate file with clear and concise explanations.
- **Code Quality:** Adheres to best coding practices with thorough documentation and clean code.
- **Learning Resource:** Ideal for anyone looking to improve their understanding of dynamic programming techniques.

## How to Use

### Clone the Repository

To clone this repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dynamic-programming-solutions.git
```

### Navigate to the Directory

Change into the repository directory:

```sh
cd dynamic-programming-solutions
```

### Compile and Run Solutions

Each solution is implemented as a class named `Solution` with appropriate methods to solve the problem. Here's a general example of how to compile and run a solution file:

1. **Compile the Solution:**

   Assuming you have a file named `ClimbingStairs.cpp`, you can compile it using `g++`:

   ```sh
   g++ -o ClimbingStairs ClimbingStairs.cpp
   ```

2. **Run the Solution:**

   You can then run the compiled program:

   ```sh
   ./ClimbingStairs
   ```

### Example Usage

For a specific problem, you might have a main function to test the `Solution` class. Here's an example of how you can structure the main function to run the `climbStairs` method from the `Solution` class:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "ClimbingStairs.cpp" // Include the appropriate solution file

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int n = 5; // Example input
    int result = solution.climbStairs(n);
    std::cout << "Number of ways to climb " << n << " stairs: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
